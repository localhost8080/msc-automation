This is a collection of utilities I made for my MSc thesis on SQL Injection

- mostly they are wrappers for sql injection tools 
- I can then automate the tools in various ways
- that means I can use these utilities to route all traffic through a proxt that records what happens for later playback
- I can also do things like authentication on apps that dont allow authentication


authentication:
- dvwa auth and cookie store
- wordpress login and keep cookie

misc:
- dvwa cleanup script

tools included:

- sqlmap
- bbqsql
- bsql hacker
- enema sql
- jsql
- metasploit
- PIXY
- safe3 sql injector
- sqlcheck
- sqlguard
- sqli hunter
- sqlix
